# Reasoning data should be rendered during streaming

## Overview

When streaming is enabled, reasoning data should be rendered in real-time as it is received. This involves updating the UI incrementally with each chunk of reasoning data, allowing users to see the AI's thought process as it unfolds.

## Terminal Output

The output below shows the reasoning data being streamed in real-time but frontend is not displaying them on real time.
