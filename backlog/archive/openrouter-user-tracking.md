# User Tracking

## Reference

- https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/user-tracking

## Overview

The OpenRouter API supports **User Tracking** through the optional `user` parameter, allowing you to track your own user IDs and improve your application's performance and reporting capabilities.

## What is User Tracking?

User tracking enables you to specify an arbitrary string identifier for your end-users in API requests. This optional metadata helps OpenRouter understand your sub-users, leading to several benefits:

1. **Improved Caching**: OpenRouter can make caches sticky to your individual users, improving load-balancing and throughput
2. **Enhanced Reporting**: View detailed analytics and activity feeds broken down by your user IDs

## How It Works

Simply include a `user` parameter in your API requests with any string identifier that represents your end-user. This could be a user ID, email hash, session identifier, or any other stable identifier you use in your application.

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?" }],
  "user": "user_12345"
}
```

## Benefits

### Improved Caching Performance

When you consistently use the same user identifier for a specific user, OpenRouter can optimize caching to be "sticky" to that user. This means:

- A given user of your application (assuming you are using caching) will always get routed to the same provider and the cache will stay warm
- But separate users can be spread over different providers, improving load-balancing and throughput

### Enhanced Reporting and Analytics

The user parameter is available in the /activity page, in the exports from that page, and in the /generations API.

- **Activity Feed**: View requests broken down by user ID in your OpenRouter dashboard
- **Usage Analytics**: Understand which users are making the most requests
- **Export Data**: Get detailed exports that include user-level breakdowns

## Implementation Example

<Template data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
  MODEL: "openai/gpt-4o"
}}>
<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import requests
import json

url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {{API_KEY_REF}}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
    "model": "{{MODEL}}",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like today?"}
    ],
    "user": "user_12345"  # Your user identifier
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(payload))
print(response.json()['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
```

```typescript TypeScript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
  apiKey: "{{API_KEY_REF}}",
});

async function chatWithUserTracking() {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "{{MODEL}}",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What's the weather like today?",
      },
    ],
    user: "user_12345", // Your user identifier
  });

  console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);
}

chatWithUserTracking();
```

</CodeGroup>
</Template>

## Best Practices

### Choose Stable Identifiers

Use consistent, stable identifiers for the same user across requests:

- **Good**: `user_12345`, `customer_abc123`, `account_xyz789`
- **Avoid**: Random strings that change between requests

### Consider Privacy

When using user identifiers, consider privacy implications:

- Use internal user IDs rather than exposing personal information
- Avoid including personally identifiable information in user identifiers
- Consider using anonymized identifiers for better privacy protection

### Be Consistent

Use the same user identifier format throughout your application:

```python
# Consistent format
user_id = f"app_{internal_user_id}"
```
