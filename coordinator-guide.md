# Human Coordinator Guide - OpenRouter Chatbot Project

## 🎯 Project Setup Complete!

Your OpenRouter Chatbot project is now fully scaffolded and ready for the AI agents to begin working. Here's what has been set up:

### ✅ Completed Setup
- ✅ Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Git repository initialized with proper structure  
- ✅ Directory structure with exclusive agent ownership areas
- ✅ Environment configuration template (`.env.example`)
- ✅ Comprehensive mission briefs for both agents
- ✅ Testing directories prepared

## 🚀 Next Steps for You

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file with your actual OpenRouter API key:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Then edit .env.local with your real API key
```

### 2. Start the AI Agents
**Give each agent their mission file:**
- **GitHub Copilot**: Provide `copilot-mission.md`
- **Gemini CLI**: Provide `gemini-cli-mission.md`

### 3. Monitor Progress via Git
```bash
# Check what agents are working on
git log --oneline -10

# See detailed changes
git show [commit-hash]

# Check current status
git status
```

### 4. Test Integration Points
```bash
# Start development server to test
npm run dev

# Run tests when available
npm test
```

## 🔍 Monitoring Checklist

**Watch for these commit patterns:**
- `[COPILOT]` - Frontend/UI work
- `[GEMINI]` - Backend/API work  
- `[SETUP]` - Initial scaffolding (completed)

**Key Integration Moments:**
1. When Gemini completes `/api/chat` endpoint
2. When Copilot builds the chat interface
3. When both agents signal readiness for integration testing

**Conflict Resolution:**
- If agents modify the same files, help resolve conflicts
- Ensure agents stay within their ownership boundaries
- Coordinate shared type definitions in `/lib/types/`

## 🛠️ Your Coordinator Responsibilities

### Technical Support
- Provide OpenRouter API key when needed
- Help resolve any import/dependency issues  
- Coordinate type definition sharing between agents
- Run integration tests and provide feedback

### Project Management
- Monitor git commits for progress tracking
- Help agents when they request assistance in commit messages
- Ensure agents follow the established protocols
- Facilitate communication between agents via git

### Quality Assurance
- Run the development server periodically: `npm run dev`
- Test the chat interface when both components are ready
- Verify environment variables are properly configured
- Check that the app builds successfully: `npm run build`

## 📞 When Agents Need Help

**Look for these signals in commit messages:**
```
[COPILOT] Need help with API integration - waiting for endpoint
[GEMINI] OpenRouter connection issues - need API key validation
[COPILOT] Ready for testing - needs backend integration
[GEMINI] API complete - ready for frontend integration
```

**Common Issues You Might Need to Resolve:**
1. **Missing Environment Variables**: Provide real API keys
2. **Type Definition Conflicts**: Help coordinate shared types
3. **Import Path Issues**: Fix relative import paths between agent areas
4. **Integration Testing**: Run the full app and report issues
5. **Dependency Conflicts**: Help resolve npm package issues

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**You'll know the project is ready when:**
- ✅ Chat interface loads without errors
- ✅ Users can type messages and click send
- ✅ Messages are sent to OpenRouter API
- ✅ AI responses are displayed in the chat
- ✅ Error states are handled gracefully
- ✅ The app is responsive on mobile/desktop

**Final Deliverables:**
- Working chat interface at `http://localhost:3000/chat`
- Landing page at `http://localhost:3000`
- Functional OpenRouter integration
- Clean, professional UI
- Error handling for edge cases

## 🚨 Emergency Commands

If you need to reset or fix issues:

```bash
# Reset to last working commit
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Clean up node_modules if needed
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Force sync with agents
git pull --rebase

# Check for conflicts
git status
```

---

**You're all set!** Give the agents their mission files and let them begin. Monitor their progress through git commits and be ready to help when they signal they need assistance. The project should be functional within 1-2 days with both agents working simultaneously.

Good luck! 🚀
