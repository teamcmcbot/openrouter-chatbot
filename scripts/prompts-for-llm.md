Surrounding the base, a temporary colony thrives under protective domes, connected by a network of tubes and tunnels, with small vehicles traversing the rugged landscape between modules.

2. A futuristic cityscape at dusk, with sleek skyscrapers made of glass and metal reflecting the vibrant colors of the setting sun. Flying cars zip through the air, leaving trails of light, while pedestrians walk along elevated walkways adorned with greenery and holographic advertisements. In the background, a massive digital billboard displays a serene nature scene, contrasting with the urban environment.

3. A serene underwater scene featuring a coral reef teeming with colorful marine life. Schools of fish in vibrant hues swim among the corals, while a gentle ray of sunlight filters down from the surface, illuminating the scene. In the distance, a curious dolphin approaches, its sleek body gliding gracefully through the water, surrounded by bubbles and swaying seaweed.

4. A cozy cabin nestled in a snowy forest during winter. The cabin is made of rustic wood, with smoke gently rising from the chimney, indicating a warm fire inside. Snow-covered pine trees surround the cabin, and a small frozen pond reflects the soft glow of lanterns hanging from the porch. In the sky above, the Northern Lights create a mesmerizing display of green and purple hues.

5. A bustling medieval marketplace filled with vendors selling colorful fabrics, fresh produce, and handmade crafts. People in period attire barter and socialize, while children play near a fountain in the center of the square. The architecture features timber-framed buildings with thatched roofs, and banners flutter in the breeze above the market stalls. In the background, a castle looms on a hill, overlooking the lively scene below.

### Reaslistic photos with humans in various scenarios (prompts should describe the art style)
