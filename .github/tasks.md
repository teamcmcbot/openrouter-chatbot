1. The settings icon (Cog6ToothIcon) in ChatSidebar, only appears users are signed in, regardless of whether there is currenrly any conversation / chat history.

2. Animate the settings icon to spin when clicked, and then stop spinning after a short duration.

3. You did not implement the first task, when signed in users with 0 chat history, the settings icon is not appearing..

4. What are the different animation effects for react-hot-toast? Currently, when you click the settings icon, the hot toast appears from top-down, can i change it to just appear or fade in from it's final position?
