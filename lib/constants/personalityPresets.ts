/**
 * Personality Preset Definitions
 * 
 * These presets provide users with curated AI personality styles.
 * Users select a preset key from the UI dropdown, and the backend
 * maps it to the full system prompt text.
 * 
 * Architecture:
 * - UI: User selects "professional" from dropdown
 * - Database: Stores "professional" (the key)
 * - OpenRouter: Maps to full systemPrompt text at runtime
 * - System Prompt Layer: root â†’ personality text â†’ custom system prompt
