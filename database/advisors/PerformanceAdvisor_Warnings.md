## Analysis and decisions (2025-09-12)

Summary

- auth_rls_initplan: Fix across the board (low-risk hardening, performance-only). Prioritize hot-path tables first.
- multiple_permissive_policies: Recommended to consolidate where semantics allow; can defer for admin-only/low-traffic tables.

Details by category

- auth_rls_initplan — “Auth RLS Initialization Plan”

  - What it means: Policies that call auth.<fn>() or current_setting(...) directly can be re-evaluated per row. Wrapping them in a scalar subquery forces a one-time evaluation, improving plans at scale.
  - Remediation pattern (no behavior change):
    - Replace auth.uid() → (select auth.uid())
    - Replace auth.role() → (select auth.role())
    - Replace current_setting('request.jwt.claim.sub', true) → (select current_setting('request.jwt.claim.sub', true))
    - Apply inside USING and WITH CHECK of the affected policies.
  - Fix decisions and priority:
    - High priority (user-facing, frequent access):
      - public.profiles — policies: Users can view/update/insert their own profile; Admins can view/update any profile → Fix
      - public.chat_sessions — view/create/update/delete own sessions → Fix
      - public.chat_messages — view/create/update/delete in own sessions → Fix
      - public.message_token_costs — user/admin view/insert paths → Fix
    - Medium priority:
      - public.chat_attachments — all CRUD → Fix
      - public.chat_message_annotations — view/insert/delete own → Fix
      - public.user_activity_log — view own activity → Fix
      - public.user_usage_daily — view/insert/update own → Fix
    - Low priority (admin-only/operational):
      - public.model_sync_log — admin view/insert/update → Fix (can defer)
      - public.admin_audit_log — admin read → Fix (can defer)
      - public.cta_events — admin read; server inserts → Fix (can defer)
      - public.anonymous_usage_daily, public.anonymous_model_usage_daily, public.anonymous_error_events — admin read → Fix (can defer)
      - public.moderation_actions — admin view/insert/update → Fix (can defer)

- multiple_permissive_policies — “Multiple Permissive Policies”
  - What it means: For the same table+role+action, more than one permissive policy exists, so Postgres evaluates multiple expressions and ORs them. Works functionally, but adds overhead and can obscure intent.
  - Remediation options:
    - Consolidate into a single policy per table+role+action with an OR of conditions, e.g. USING (is_admin() OR user_id = (select auth.uid())).
    - Alternatively, keep separate policies for clarity and accept minor overhead (safe to defer on low-traffic paths).
  - Decisions:
    - public.message_token_costs — roles anon/authenticated/authenticator/dashboard_user for SELECT and INSERT have duplicate permissive policies → Recommended: Consolidate per role/action. Keep behavior identical by OR-combining “Admins can …” with “Users can …”. Priority: High (hot-path analytics).
    - public.profiles — roles anon/authenticated/authenticator/dashboard_user for SELECT/UPDATE have duplicate permissive policies → Recommended: Consolidate per role/action. Priority: Medium (moderate frequency; still worth simplifying).

Implementation notes (for future patch)

- Use ALTER POLICY to update USING/WITH CHECK in place (no drop needed):
  - ALTER POLICY policy_name ON schema.table USING (<updated_expr>) WITH CHECK (<updated_expr>);
- Validate with EXPLAIN to confirm initplan optimization on representative queries.
- No app code changes expected; behavior remains identical when expressions are semantically preserved.

Verification checklist

- Re-run the Performance Advisor after changes; all listed auth_rls_initplan warnings should clear.
- For multiple_permissive_policies, the duplicates should disappear where consolidation was applied.
