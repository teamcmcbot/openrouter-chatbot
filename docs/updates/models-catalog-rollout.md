# Models Catalog Rollout Notes

**Last Updated:** September 28, 2025  
**Related Work:** Feature filters + sitemap integration (`feature/models-page` branch)

## Overview

We launched the public `/models` catalog page with capability-driven filtering to help visitors evaluate supported OpenRouter providers and tiers. The update replaces the former Base/Pro/Enterprise filter pills with feature toggles and aligns the page with SEO and caching standards.

## Feature Highlights

- **Feature Toggles:** Users can stack filters for multimodal, reasoning, image generation, free, and paid access to narrow results quickly.
- **Deep Link Support:** Query params `q`, `feature`, and `tier` synchronize with the UI for shareable URLs.
- **Structured Data:** `/models` is now part of the sitemap; metadata inherits from the default layout for better indexing.
- **Cached Payloads:** Data requests leverage the Redis-backed `model-access:active` cache (5–10 minute TTL) with manual bust hooks in admin tooling.
- **Test Coverage:** Unit tests guard helper predicates, provider classification, and query parsing; component tests verify UI behaviors.

## Rollout Checklist

1. **Cache Warm-up:** Trigger the catalog fetch or hit `/models` once per environment after deployment so the Redis cache primes promptly.
2. **Monitoring:** Watch `modelCatalog.fetch`, `modelCatalog.cache.hit`, and `modelCatalog.cache.miss` logs for spikes or unexpected misses.
3. **Landing Page Links:** Confirm pricing CTA buttons point to `/models?tier=<tier>`; analytics events continue to fire post-navigation.
4. **Feature Flags:** No feature flag is required—the page is permanently enabled for public sessions.
5. **Incident Response:** If filters misbehave, flush the `model-access:*` keys and redeploy; the catalog gracefully degrades to server fetches.

## Validation Steps

- Open `/models` in an incognito window and verify it renders without authentication.
- Toggle multiple feature filters (e.g., Multimodal + Reasoning) and confirm the result set updates instantly.
- Search with `?q=claude` and refresh; the filtered view persists.
- Visit `/models?tier=enterprise` from the landing page CTA and ensure the enterprise section scrolls into view.
- Run `npm test -- --testPathPattern modelCatalog` to rerun helper/component suites if regression checks are needed.

## Follow-up Actions

- Coordinate optional announcement copy with marketing once analytics confirm engagement targets.
- Evaluate additional SEO enhancements (OpenGraph cards, structured data) in a future iteration if traffic warrants.
