# Security Review for Markdown Implementation

## XSS Prevention

### ✅ Built-in Protections

1. **React-Markdown Sanitization**: React-markdown sanitizes HTML by default and prevents script injection
2. **Custom Components**: All custom components avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
3. **External Links**: Links properly use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to prevent window.opener attacks

### ✅ Security Features Implemented

- **Target="\_blank" with Security**: External links open in new tabs with proper rel attributes
- **Content Validation**: Only renders markdown through safe React components
- **No Direct HTML**: No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` anywhere in the implementation

### ✅ Additional Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Content comes from trusted LLM APIs
- **Size Limits**: Message content has practical size limits from API responses
- **No User HTML Input**: Users cannot directly input HTML, only plain text

## Conclusion

The markdown implementation follows security best practices and is safe for production use.
