# Security Review for OpenRouter Chatbot

## Rate Limiting Security

### ✅ Redis-Based Rate Limiting (Production-Ready)

**Status**: **FIXED** - Previously broken in-memory rate limiting has been replaced with Redis-based solution.

1. **Serverless Compatible**: Uses Redis for persistent state across serverless function invocations
2. **Accurate Enforcement**: Sliding window algorithm with atomic Redis operations prevents bypass
3. **Tier-Based Protection**: Different limits for anonymous, free, pro, and enterprise users
4. **IP-Based Fallback**: Anonymous users are rate-limited by IP address
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Continues to function if Redis is temporarily unavailable

### ✅ Rate Limiting Implementation

```typescript
// Current Implementation (SECURE)
import { withRedisRateLimit } from "../../../lib/middleware/redisRateLimitMiddleware";

export const POST = withProtectedAuth(withRedisRateLimit(chatHandler));
```

**Rate Limits by Tier:**

- **Anonymous**: 20 requests/hour (IP-based)
- **Free**: 100 requests/hour (user-based)
- **Pro**: 1000 requests/hour (user-based)
- **Enterprise**: 5000 requests/hour (user-based)

### ✅ Security Features

- **Atomic Operations**: Redis pipeline prevents race conditions
- **Sliding Window**: Resistant to burst attacks at window boundaries
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old rate limit entries expire automatically
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail of rate limiting decisions

## XSS Prevention

### ✅ Built-in Protections

1. **React-Markdown Sanitization**: React-markdown sanitizes HTML by default and prevents script injection
2. **Custom Components**: All custom components avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
3. **External Links**: Links properly use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to prevent window.opener attacks

### ✅ Security Features Implemented

- **Target="\_blank" with Security**: External links open in new tabs with proper rel attributes
- **Content Validation**: Only renders markdown through safe React components
- **No Direct HTML**: No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` anywhere in the implementation

### ✅ Additional Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Content comes from trusted LLM APIs
- **Size Limits**: Message content has practical size limits from API responses
- **No User HTML Input**: Users cannot directly input HTML, only plain text

## Cost Protection

### ✅ Redis Rate Limiting Cost Analysis

**Development**: FREE tier (10,000 commands/day)
**Production**: Pay-as-you-go ($0.2 per 100K commands)

**Typical Usage**:

- 4 Redis commands per API request
- 1000 requests/day = 4000 commands = $0.008/day
- Monthly cost projection: ~$1-10 for typical usage

**Risk Mitigation**:

- Prevents unlimited API abuse that could cost $10,000+/day
- Redis costs scale linearly with legitimate usage
- Built-in monitoring and alerting via Upstash dashboard

## Conclusion

The application implements comprehensive security measures:

- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Production-ready Redis-based protection
- ✅ **XSS Prevention**: Safe markdown rendering
- ✅ **Cost Protection**: Controlled API usage with monitoring
- ✅ **Authentication**: Tier-based access control

All security implementations follow industry best practices and are production-ready.

## Internal Job Endpoint Security (New)

- Internal endpoints (e.g., `/api/internal/sync-models`, `/api/internal/attachments/cleanup`) are not user-facing and must not depend on cookies.
- Authentication is enforced via per-endpoint secrets:
  - Authorization: `Bearer <INTERNAL_*_TOKEN>` (e.g., `INTERNAL_SYNC_TOKEN`, `INTERNAL_CLEANUP_TOKEN`), or
  - `X-Signature` HMAC-SHA256 over the raw request body using `INTERNAL_*_SECRET`.
- Benefits:
  - Consistent authorization independent of browser context
  - Tamper detection with HMAC where used
  - Standardized error handling and timing-safe comparisons
- Recommendations:
  - Use per-endpoint secrets for least privilege and easier rotation/disable.
  - Rotate secrets periodically and store them only in server-side env.
  - Use a scheduler (Vercel Cron/Workflows or Supabase Scheduled Function) that injects the secret header.
  - Keep rate limiting enabled at the middleware or platform edge where possible.

## Database Hardening (Phase 4)

- FORCE RLS enabled on `public.model_access` and `public.model_sync_log` to enforce policy checks even for default roles.
- RPCs that modify data continue to use SECURITY DEFINER with narrow scope.

## Auditability (Phase 4)

- Admin/system actions are logged to `public.admin_audit_log` via `public.write_admin_audit` (SECURITY DEFINER).
- `actor_user_id` is nullable to allow system/scheduled entries; RLS allows SELECT only to admins and denies direct INSERTs.
