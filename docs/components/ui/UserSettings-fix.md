# UserSettings Component Investigation and Fix

## Issue Summary

The `UserSettings.tsx` component was not pulling user's profile data from the session and was instead displaying hardcoded mock data.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Findings

1. **Component Issue**: The `UserSettings.tsx` component was using hardcoded user data:

   ```tsx
   const user = {
     email: "user@example.com",
     fullName: "Jane Doe",
     subscription: "Free",
   };
   ```

2. **Authentication Architecture**: The application uses Zustand stores for state management, not React Context:

   - Auth state is managed by `useAuthStore` from `stores/useAuthStore.ts`
   - The component was initially trying to use `useAuth` from `hooks/useAuth.ts` which references `AuthContext`
   - The correct approach is to use `useAuth` exported from the auth store

3. **Database Schema**: Complete user profile data is available in the database:
   - `profiles` table contains: `email`, `full_name`, `avatar_url`, `subscription_tier`, etc.
   - User data is automatically synced from Google OAuth via database triggers
   - Profile preferences stored in `ui_preferences` and `session_preferences` JSONB fields

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made

1. **Updated Import**: Changed from `hooks/useAuth` to `stores/useAuthStore`

   ```tsx
   // Before
   import { useAuth } from "../../hooks/useAuth";

   // After
   import { useAuth } from "../../stores/useAuthStore";
   ```

2. **Fixed Hook Usage**: Corrected the destructuring to match auth store API

   ```tsx
   // Before
   const { user, loading } = useAuth();

   // After
   const { user, isLoading } = useAuth();
   ```

3. **Real Data Integration**: Updated component to use actual user data from session

   ```tsx
   // Before - hardcoded
   const user = {
     email: "user@example.com",
     fullName: "Jane Doe",
     subscription: "Free",
   };

   // After - from session
   const userProfile = {
     email: user?.email || "Not signed in",
     fullName:
       user?.user_metadata?.full_name ||
       user?.user_metadata?.name ||
       "Guest User",
     subscription: "Free", // TODO: Get this from user profile when available
   };
   ```

4. **Loading State**: Added proper loading state handling for auth initialization

### TODO Items for Future Enhancement

1. **Subscription Tier**: Fetch actual subscription tier from user profile database
2. **User Preferences**: Integrate with database `ui_preferences` and `session_preferences`
3. **Real Analytics**: Connect to actual usage data from `user_usage_daily` table
4. **Complete Profile**: Use `get_user_complete_profile()` database function for full data

## Verification

### Build Success

- `npm run build` passes successfully
- No compilation errors or TypeScript issues

### Test Results

- All 22 test suites pass (190 tests total)
- UserSettings component test specifically passes
- No regression issues introduced

### Architecture Compliance

- Follows existing Zustand store pattern
- Proper client-side component with "use client" directive
- Handles SSR correctly (no useAuth context errors during build)

## Next Steps

1. **Enhanced Profile Data**: Create a service to fetch complete user profile using database functions
2. **Preferences Integration**: Connect UI preferences to actual database storage
3. **Real-time Sync**: Consider implementing real-time profile updates when user changes settings
4. **Analytics Display**: Show actual usage statistics from the database

## Files Modified

- `/components/ui/UserSettings.tsx` - Main fix implementation

## Database Integration Opportunities

The database schema supports rich user profile data that could be fully integrated:

- Complete user preferences (theme, model defaults, etc.)
- Usage analytics and statistics
- Subscription tier and credit information
- Activity logs and usage tracking

This fix resolves the immediate issue while establishing a foundation for comprehensive profile data integration.
