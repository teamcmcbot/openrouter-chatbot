### Tips for Writing Custom Instructions

principles. Assume I have intermediate finance knowledge. Use industry
terminology but explain complex concepts clearly.
```

You are a senior software engineer helping me learn Python. Explain
concepts clearly, show code examples, and guide me to discover
solutions rather than just giving answers. Point out best practices
and common pitfalls.
```

## 🔄 How Personality Settings Work

### The Layered Prompt System

Behind the scenes, your personality settings are combined in layers:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Root System Prompt                  │  Always included
│    (Brand-specific instructions)       │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. Personality Preset (if selected)    │  Your chosen style
│    "You are a witty AI assistant..."   │
├────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. Custom Instructions (if added)      │  Your specific needs
│    "Expert in finance..."              │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
    Final AI Behavior
```

This means:

- **All three layers work together**
- **Each layer adds specific characteristics**
- **The AI combines all instructions coherently**

### Example: Full System Prompt

**Your Settings:**

- Preset: 😄 Witty & Clever
- Custom: "You are an expert in Python programming"

**What the AI receives:**

1. Root: "You are a helpful AI assistant with strong capabilities..."
2. Personality: "You are witty and clever, using wordplay and humor..."
3. Custom: "You are an expert in Python programming"

**Result:** A witty AI that knows Python well and makes programming fun!

Not yet! Currently, personality settings apply to all new conversations. Changing your settings won't affect ongoing chats. This feature may be added in the future.

### What happens if I don't select a preset?

If you select "-- No Preset --", only your custom instructions (if any) are used along with the root system prompt. This gives you maximum control.

### Can I use custom instructions without a preset?

Yes! Select "-- No Preset --" from the dropdown and write your own custom instructions. This is perfect for advanced users who want full control.

### Do personality settings affect all models?

Yes, personality settings apply to all AI models you chat with. The layered prompt system works with Claude, GPT, and all other supported models.

### How do I reset to default?

1. Open User Settings → Preferences
2. Select "-- No Preset --" from dropdown
3. Clear the Custom System Prompt field
4. Click Save

This returns you to the default behavior (root system prompt only).

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### My personality preset isn't showing after I save

**Solution:**

1. Hard refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
2. Check that you clicked "Save" (not just "Cancel")
3. Try logging out and back in
4. Check browser console for errors

### My custom instructions are too long

**Solution:**

- Maximum: 2,000 characters
- Try being more concise
- Focus on the most important instructions
- Remove redundant phrases

### The AI isn't following my personality preset

**Possible causes:**

1. **New conversation needed:** Settings only apply to new chats
2. **Conflicting instructions:** Your custom prompt might contradict the preset
3. **Model limitations:** Some models handle personality better than others
4. **Root prompt override:** Brand instructions may take precedence in some cases

**Try:**

- Start a fresh conversation
- Be more explicit in custom instructions
- Try a different preset
- Report the issue if it persists

### I can't save my settings

**Check:**

- ✅ Are you logged in?
- ✅ Is your internet connection stable?
