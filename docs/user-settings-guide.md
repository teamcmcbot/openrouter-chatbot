  - Save is disabled when invalid or empty; input is trimmed before save

##### System Prompt Preview

When not in edit mode, a preview shows the beginning of your system prompt using word-boundary truncation (~200 chars) for readability.

##### Editing and Saving

1. Click "Edit" in Preferences
2. Modify the System Prompt in the textarea
3. Watch the character counter and validation indicators
4. Click "Save" to persist changes
   - Success: green toast, preview updates, edit mode closes
   - Failure: red toast, value reverts to last known good, stays in edit mode

##### Validation Rules

- 1‚Äì2000 characters after trimming
- Rejects unsafe content:
  - HTML/script patterns: <script>, <iframe>, <object>, <embed>, on\*=, javascript:, data:text/html
  - Control characters: ASCII 0‚Äì8, 11‚Äì12, 14‚Äì31, 127
  - Excessive whitespace: >50 consecutive spaces or >10 consecutive newlines

##### Accessibility

- Textarea uses `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` for errors/help
- Keyboard accessible controls and clear focus styles

##### Tips for Effective Prompts

- Be specific about tone, role, and style
- Include constraints (formatting, brevity, citation rules)
- Keep it concise; long prompts may reduce response efficiency

### 4. Available Models

See which AI models you can access based on your subscription tier:

- **Model List**: All models available to your account
- **Usage Limits**: Daily and monthly limits for each model
- **Model Information**: Descriptions and capabilities of each model
- **Access Level**: Whether models are available with your current subscription

## Understanding Analytics Data

### What Counts as a Message?

- Each text you send to the AI counts as one message
- AI responses also count toward your message total
- System messages and errors are not counted

### Token Usage Explained

- **Tokens**: Units of text that AI models process (roughly 1 token = 0.75 words)
- **Input Tokens**: Tokens from your messages and conversation context
- **Output Tokens**: Tokens generated by the AI in responses
- **Total Tokens**: Sum of input and output tokens

### Session Tracking

- **Session**: A continuous conversation thread
- **New sessions** are created when you start a fresh conversation
- **Active minutes** track time spent actually interacting (not idle time)

## Customizing Your Experience

### Choosing the Right Model

- **Free Tier**: Access to basic models with usage limits
- **Pro Tier**: Access to advanced models with higher limits
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited access to all available models

### Default Model Management

The default model setting determines which AI model is automatically selected for new conversations. You have several options:

#### Setting Your Default Model

1. **Specific Model**: Choose a particular model that will be used for all new conversations

   - Best for consistent experience with a preferred model
   - Ensures predictable behavior across sessions
   - May become unavailable if your subscription changes or model is deprecated

2. **None (Automatic Selection)**: Let the system choose the best available model
   - System selects optimal model based on your tier and availability
   - Automatically adapts when new models are added or removed
   - Recommended for users who want the latest and best available options

#### Handling Model Availability

- **Available Models**: Models shown in dropdown are accessible with your current subscription
- **Unavailable Default**: If your current default model is no longer available, it will display with "(Not available)" indicator
- **Model Transitions**: When models are deprecated or subscription changes, you can easily switch to "None" or select a new specific model

#### Best Practices

- **Regular Review**: Periodically check if your default model is still available and suitable
- **Tier Changes**: When upgrading/downgrading subscription, review and update your default model
- **New Features**: Consider switching to "None" to automatically benefit from newly released models
- **Backup Plan**: If you prefer a specific model, have a backup choice in mind

### Optimizing Temperature Settings

- **0.0 - 0.3**: Highly focused, deterministic responses (good for factual questions)
- **0.4 - 0.7**: Balanced creativity and focus (recommended for most uses)
- **0.8 - 1.2**: More creative and varied responses
- **1.3 - 2.0**: Maximum creativity (may be less consistent)

### Effective System Prompts

- Keep prompts clear and specific
- Define the AI's role (e.g., "You are a helpful coding assistant")
- Include any special instructions or constraints
- Avoid overly long or complex prompts
