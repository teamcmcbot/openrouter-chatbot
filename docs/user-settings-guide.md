## Understanding Analytics Data

### What Counts as a Message?

- Each text you send to the AI counts as one message
- AI responses also count toward your message total
- System messages and errors are not counted

### Token Usage Explained

- **Tokens**: Units of text that AI models process (roughly 1 token = 0.75 words)
- **Input Tokens**: Tokens from your messages and conversation context
- **Output Tokens**: Tokens generated by the AI in responses
- **Total Tokens**: Sum of input and output tokens

### Session Tracking

- **Session**: A continuous conversation thread
- **New sessions** are created when you start a fresh conversation
- **Active minutes** track time spent actually interacting (not idle time)

## Customizing Your Experience

### Choosing the Right Model

- **Free Tier**: Access to basic models with usage limits
- **Pro Tier**: Access to advanced models with higher limits
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited access to all available models

### Optimizing Temperature Settings

- **0.0 - 0.3**: Highly focused, deterministic responses (good for factual questions)
- **0.4 - 0.7**: Balanced creativity and focus (recommended for most uses)
- **0.8 - 1.2**: More creative and varied responses
- **1.3 - 2.0**: Maximum creativity (may be less consistent)

### Effective System Prompts

- Keep prompts clear and specific
- Define the AI's role (e.g., "You are a helpful coding assistant")
- Include any special instructions or constraints
- Avoid overly long or complex prompts
