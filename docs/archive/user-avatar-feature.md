# User Avatar Feature

## Overview

The chat interface now displays user avatars for signed-in users instead of the generic "ME" text. This provides a more personalized and visually appealing chat experience.

## Implementation

### Feature Details

- **Signed-in users with avatar**: Shows the user's profile picture from their authentication provider (Google OAuth)
- **Signed-in users without avatar**: Falls back to "ME" text
- **Anonymous users**: Shows "ME" text
- **Assistant messages**: Always shows "AI" text (unchanged)
- **Error handling**: If avatar image fails to load, automatically falls back to "ME" text

### Technical Implementation

- Uses Next.js `Image` component for optimized loading
- Integrates with existing `useAuth()` context to access user data
- Avatar URL comes from `user.user_metadata.avatar_url` (Supabase Auth)
- Includes error handling with `onError` callback
- Maintains existing responsive design and dark mode support

### Components Modified

- `MessageList.tsx`: Updated avatar rendering logic for user messages
- Added imports for Next.js Image component and useAuth hook
- Added error handling state for failed avatar loads

### Testing

- Comprehensive test coverage for all avatar scenarios
- Tests for signed-in users (with/without avatar)
- Tests for anonymous users
- Tests for assistant messages (ensuring no avatar interference)
- Integration with existing MessageList test suite

## Usage

The feature works automatically when users sign in with Google OAuth. No additional configuration is required.

### User Experience

1. **Before sign-in**: User sees "ME" in emerald circle for their messages
2. **After sign-in (with Google avatar)**: User sees their profile picture in circular frame
3. **After sign-in (no avatar)**: User continues to see "ME" text
4. **Error scenarios**: If avatar fails to load, gracefully falls back to "ME"

## Benefits

- Enhanced personalization for authenticated users
- Improved visual distinction between user and AI messages
- Seamless integration with existing authentication system
- Maintains accessibility and fallback behavior
- No impact on anonymous user experience
