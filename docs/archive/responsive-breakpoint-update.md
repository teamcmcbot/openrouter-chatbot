# Responsive Breakpoint Update for Better iPad Support

## Overview

Updated the responsive breakpoint for the 3-column layout from `md` (768px) to `xl` (1280px) to provide better user experience on tablet devices, particularly iPad Pro with 1024px width.

## Problem Statement

The original implementation used Tailwind's `md` breakpoint (768px) to switch between mobile and desktop layouts. This caused issues on devices with 1024px width (like iPad Pro):

- **Insufficient Space**: At 1024px with 15%-70%-15% columns, sidebars only got ~153px width
- **Poor Content Readability**: Cramped sidebar content
- **Inconsistent UX**: Tablets are primarily touch devices and should follow mobile interaction patterns

## Solution

Changed all responsive breakpoints from `md:` (768px) to `xl:` (1280px) in the layout components.

### Breakpoint Comparison

| Breakpoint | Width   | Use Case                             |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `md`       | 768px+  | Small tablets and up                 |
| `xl`       | 1280px+ | Large tablets, laptops, and desktops |

### Benefits

1. **Better Space Utilization**: At 1280px, sidebars get ~192px and chat gets ~896px
2. **Consistent Touch UX**: iPads and similar devices now use mobile-style overlays
3. **Improved Readability**: More comfortable content spacing
4. **Future-Proof**: Works well with various tablet sizes

## Files Modified

### 1. `components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx`
